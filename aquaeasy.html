          <p class="font-secondary mb-5">Jun 27, 2022</p>
          <div class="content blog">
              <b>Background </b>
              <p> Do you love seafood? Over half of the world consumes seafood on a regular basis. It is one of the best sources of protein. Shrimp specifically is very rich in protein, up to 45%. No wonder it is a popular delicacy all over the world. However, as the world population continues to grow the oceans cannot meet this demand anymore. As a result, there has been a major shift towards inland farming. 
Inland farming has brought along another set of unique challenges, diseases due to a confined environment, water quality, environmental impact of wastewater amongst others. These problems need to be tackled before inland aquaculture can come mainstream and ease the load on our oceans. 
AquaEasy has developed a smart aquaculture solution which combines sensors, software, AI and data analytics capabilities to help shrimp farmers achieve better predictability, higher productivity and sustainability. In short, it collects data, analyses the data, and puts forth recommendations that help farmers to make better farming decisions.  
For AI to churn out meaningful recommendations, data entry into the AquaEasy mobile app is critical. This data includes- feeding data, lab work, average body weight of shrimp, etc. However, one of the challenges AquaEasy faced was lack of timely data entry from the pond technicians. Let us explore how UX and design thinking solved this problem.
</p>

<b>Step one — Empathise</b>
              <p> 
Who are we designing for? Current user groups in Indonesia and Vietnam who are primarily shrimp farmers or farm technicians in rural areas of both countries. They are experienced in running their farms based on their conventional wisdom. Most of them have had limited primary or secondary education. They are being impacted negatively by the challenges of inland shrimp farming, specifically water borne diseases affecting their shrimp production.  </p>

<b>Step two— Define (the Problem)</b>
              <p> 
Through the observations of the local sales and customer support staff, data entry is considered an extra work for them. As a result, they don’t key in the data which is required by the AI to provide critical farming recommendations to support their farming. With the absence of recommendations, the farmers have not realized the benefit of this technology. 

Step three — Ideation</b>
              <p> 
What can we do to help? How can we design an experience for such a situation? How can we encourage the farmer to key-in data regularly? Enter gamification. To that end, we designed a rewards program, taking into consideration that data entry is extra work for these farmers. In this case, users are awarded points for every manual data entry performed e.g., entering MBW or entering Lab data earns 1 point each. The points can be redeemed for rewards such as prepaid top-up cards or grocery gift cards which are valued by this user group.  </p>

<b>

Step four —Prototype</b>
              <p> 
These are the prototype screens for the gamification of AquaEasy mobile app: </p>

<b>
  

Step five — Let’s test</b>
              <p> 
Within few months of launching the rewards program, the rate of data entry has increased by 30%. Users were even asking to be rewarded for other data entry pages to be included for the rewards program! The rewards encourage shrimp farmers to remain motivated to perform data entry. So now, AquaEasy gets the data to train the AI and the farm gets more accurate recommendations based on the data provided.   </p>

<b>
 
Reiteration</b>
              <p> 
Based on user feedback, the rewards program was further enhanced. The number of reward points awarded was tuned based on the complexity of data entry e.g., entering MBW earns 1 point each while entering Lab data earns 5 points. The importance of data for improving the AI engine was also taken into account.
Based on each shrimp farm worker’s current role, they are assigned to a team and a specific role that requires them to complete daily tasks that are reflective of their current responsibilities. Each team member will earn AquaPoints for every task completed. The sum of AquaPoints earned by all members at the end of each shrimp cycle will then determine how much rewards each team will receive. 
As such, the new rewards program encourages everyone responsible for the shrimp ponds to work together to earn AquaPoints by regularly entering data.  </p>

<b>
 
The takeaway</b>
              <p> 
  Good design fosters good behaviour. In this case, AquaEasy is fostering team spirit and at the same time, empowering shrimp farmers to feed the world.

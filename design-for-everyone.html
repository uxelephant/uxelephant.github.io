          <p class="font-secondary mb-5">Oct 17, 2020</p>
          <div class="content blog">
              <p>Design should be inclusive, accessible,
                informative, and flexible for every user. However, often we forget that people who have disabilities are
                also the recipients of our design. According to the WHO, a billion people worldwide have some form of
                disability, which is about 15% of the world population.</p>
              <p><strong>Accessibility Design<br></strong>What is accessibility design,
                you might ask? In the context of design, accessibility responds to the users’ needs to use and interact
                with a design. For accessibility to include everyone, it means being accessible to all, irrespective of
                one’s personal, cultural, physical, and socioeconomic status.</p>
              <p>In the web context, it means people with disabilities,
                can understand, perceive, control, and interact with web elements like everyone else. Accessibility is
                not creating a separate page or website, it is about providing a website that is usable by everyone and
                on every device, be it computer, table, smart phone, TV, screen reader, or braille
                display. <br/>So what are the areas of disability we should consider?<br/><br/>

                <strong><em>Visual</em></strong>This is the most common forms of disability
                that hinders accessibility arise due to problems in visual communication. Different kinds of visual
                impairment, such as reduced or limited eyesight, colour blindness, and blindness, must be considered
                while designing.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong><em>Mobility</em></strong>The use of arms and legs can come as an
                issue for the physically impaired. They might have problems accessing the web and even some keyboard and
                mouse features.<br>&nbsp;<br> <strong><em>Auditory</em></strong>An auditory impairment can vary from mild
                to a profound loss in hearing ability.</p>
              <p> <strong><em>Cognitive</em></strong>Some people suffer from neuro-cognitive
                disabilities, including seizures, dyslexia, and sensitivity to light. Problems associated with
                visualising the design at hand and short-term memory issues position the disability in this category.
              </p>
              <p><strong >Codes
                  and Guidelines</strong>There are codes and guidelines of accessibility when it comes to designing
                for people with disabilities, such as Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and Web Content
                Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).</p>
              <p>In a nutshell, ADA is a civil rights law that prohibits
                the discrimination of people with disabilities in all areas of life, including when using electronic and
                information technology. The WCAG is an ISO standard set of guidelines from W3C (World Wide Web
                Consortium) for creating an accessible website for people with disabilities.<br>&nbsp;<br>What happens
                if my website is not compliant to these guidelines in the legal point of view? For an example, if we are
                designing for the users in the United States, breaking the Americans with Disabilities Act carries fines
                $55,000 to $75,000 for first-time violations and $150,000 for every repeat violation. WCAG serves as a
                reference for ADA website compliance; organisations looking to make their websites compliant with ADA
                should reference and follow WCAG.<br>&nbsp;<br><strong >Building
                  accessible websites<br></strong>To include users with visual, auditory, motor, and cognitive
                disabilities, it is not just about using good alternative texts for images on the website. So where
                should we start? Let’s look at some guides to make this possible.</p>
              <p> <strong><em>Use the right Semantics</em><br></strong>Writing good HTML with the
                right semantics is important&hairsp;—&hairsp;there is a reason all those tags exist. It is highly
                recommended to use the extended set of HTML5 elements and attributes from user experience perspective as
                well.</p>
              <p> <strong><em>Use the right colours</em><br></strong>Colour contrast is crucial
                for seamless and understandable designs. However, it is important to not rely on colour alone to convey
                meaning.</p>
              <p> <strong><em>Review the DOM tree</em></strong>The browser takes the DOM tree
                and modifies it into a form that is useful to assistive technology such as the screen reader.</p>
              <p> <strong><em>Enable no mouse navigation</em></strong>Keyboard navigation is
                one of the most used navigation after the mouse on the Web, especially for the people with motor
                disabilities.</p>
              <p> <strong><em>Enable screen reader announcements</em></strong>For instance, if
                there are errors in a form that has been submitted alert the user in an accessible way and make it easy
                to re-enter the incorrect information and resubmit the form.<br>&nbsp;<br>The above are just some basic
                tips, and make sure you will not forget to refer to WCAG guidelines for compliance.</p>
                <br/>
              <p><strong
                  >Conclusion</strong>Understanding and planning for web
                accessibility should be included from the beginning and throughout the design and development process.
                As we become more aware of the needs of people who have disabilities, responding to their needs has
                become a priority. In return, it tends to improve usability and inclusiveness of products and services
                altogether.</p>
